## Overview

The OnGuard first and last names are indexed separately. Bugs fixed for concurrent OnGuard badge-ins on turnstiles within the same camera view, saving labels on large Events, and authenticated sharing via link with the account specified.

## Improvements

- **first and last names indexed separately** for Lenel OnGuard badge-ins so that queries can specify only one of those names without relying on knowing both names or on quoting multi-word query terms. e.g. you can query [https://camio.com/app/#search;q=smith](https://camio.com/app/#search;q=smith) to find anyone with the last name or first name of "smith".

## Bug Fixes

- **concurrent OnGuard unlocks** with the same timestamp on multi-turnstile entrances (e.g. in lobbies) within the same camera view are now correctly counted for each badge swipe despite OnGuard's lack of millisecond precision on the timestamps of the swipes.
- **rare errors in saving labels now fixed** after finding that the saving of user-added labels had not been compressing Event metadata prior to saving, thereby exceeding storage limits on rare large Events.
- **user account included in authenticated share via link** URL that had previously omitted the user account. This ensures that the shared links search the intended account when sharing among coworkers with access to multiple accounts.
