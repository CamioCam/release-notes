## Overview

New support for policy compliance assessments using [Camio Vector Search](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/categories/27636194796436-Vector-Search), multiple door readers covered by a single camera, and other features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## New Features

- **Policy Compliance Overlay** on the Event Viewer now shows the COMPLIANT or NONCOMPLIANT policy assessment results from [Camio Vector Search](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/sections/27636301644180-Using-Vector-Search) along with a link to its JSON output.

- **Snapshot and Video Vector Search** is now included in the partner [price quote tool](https://camio.com/tools/plans/config).

- **Color badges on Event tiles that match a query** can now be assigned on the Search History panel by selecting the perferred color. The selections are retained only in the Web Browser's local storage currently. See [How can I make higher priority Events stand out in my Event Stream](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/27797418388116-How-can-I-make-higher-priority-Events-stand-out-in-my-Event-Stream).

## Improvements

- **Domain-level API Hooks** are now created when a [Camera Group](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038487551-How-can-I-share-a-group-of-cameras) is specified in the query of the Hook. Since a Camera Group can span multiple accounts of the same domain, the presence of a Camera Group enables the single Hook to apply to any accounts of the domain. For example, to trigger a Vector Search policy assessment every time a person is in any cleanroom around the world, create a single Hook using the Camera Group `Cleanrooms` in the Hook's query `people Cleanrooms`.

- **CPU Core Utilization is now formatted** on the [Support Page](https://camio.com/tools/accounts/) to show each CPU core's value as percentage and color-coded by level of utilization (from gray at 0% to red at 100%).

- **The new Camio Box 1776R and 1735R** are now in the price quote and [hardware estimation](https://camio.com/tools/estimates/hardware) tools along with price increases resulting from supplier price increases.

- **Multiple readers can be assigned to a camera** so that tailgating analysis is performed on multiple doorways within view of a single camera when using Brivo or Openpath (Avigilon Alta).

## Bug Fixes

- **Event `labels` are now escaped in CSV Export of Search Results** to fix the escaping ommission that surfaced once commas were allowed in that field as part of supporting the generated output of Vector Search.

- **Tailgating email notifications use the FROM specified** in the Tailgating integration settings.

- **Brivo readers fetched completely** with a fix for paginated results to ensure exhaustive retrieval of readers.
