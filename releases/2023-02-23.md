## Overview

Search operator `p:` now works for search and alerts, access control events indexed by name of person for quoted searches.

## Improvements

- The `p:` search operator used to specify probability threshold on Event classifications now works for search and alerts. Previously, the `p:` search operator was parsed only to be used with `event_auto_upload_query_filter` to govern which Events were uploaded to the cloud. Now searches like https://camio.com/app/#search;q=human+p:60 can be used to see results where, in this example, the classification of `human` was 60% or higher (instead of the default 80% used for the `human` label).

- For physical access control systems that include the name of the person associated with the event (e.g. the person who unlocked a door), Camio now indexes the name for quoted string searches in lowercase like https://camio.com/app/#search;q=%22john+smith%22
