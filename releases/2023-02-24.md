## Overview

All cameras from all host accounts are included in the search box auto-complete, long camera names wrap in the search panel.

## Improvements

- All cameras shared with the authenticated user are now shown in the search box auto-complete. Those cameras are cached locally in the browser until there's a change to a host account or until the max-age of the cache is reached (currently max-age 10 minutes).

- The camera buttons of the Search Panel now wrap long text camera names so that they're visible without the need to hover over each button.
