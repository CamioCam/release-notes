## Overview

This release includes the following updates:

## New Features

- Add camio.com/release-notes - Adds a redirect so any Camio user can go to camio.com/release-notes to see the latest release notes for each user facing product without having to remember the Github url.
- Custom Label support - Custom labels are now included in the bottom right of the Panzoom viewer. For example, if a label called `cleaning_start` exists, it will be displayed in the list of access control labels along with the time at which it occurred.
- Go to label timestamp - You can now click the underlined timestamp in the bottom right of the Panzoom viewer to advance video playback to the precise time in which that label occurred.

## Bug Fixes

- Panzoom Viewer hidden - Fixes a bug where the panzoom viewer wasn't able to be switched to using the "m" key if the user had lazy indexing enabled.
- Labels button not working - Fixes a bug where clicking on the labels button did not display the labels dropdown.
