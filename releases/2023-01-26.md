## Overview

The CSV import field `labels` is now a wholesale replacement of any prior Camera Labels, other bug fixes.

## Improvements

- The [CSV import](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000805563-Can-I-import-cameras-from-a-CSV-file-) and all API endpoints for updating Camera Labels (`labels`) now treat the payload of the request as a wholesale replacement of any prior `labels`. 
If the field `labels` is omitted from the request, then no change is made. In the case of CSV import, an empty string (blank space(s)) will remove all `labels`.


## Bug Fixes

- The websocket session tokens are now correctly stored for retrieval upon memcache misses (correcting the symptom of new users who would sometimes not receive the websocket notifications required for [Event Streaming](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026639752-How-can-our-SOC-video-wall-display-important-Events-as-they-happen-)).
- Camera Labels specified in the CSV import file field names `labels` are now trimmed for blank spaces to mitigate data entry errors.
- The /box/register page now trims blank spaces in email and MAC to avoid data entry errors.
