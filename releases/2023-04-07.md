## Overview
Improved autocomplete functionality for the Search Box.

## Improvements
The Search Box's autocomplete feature has been enhanced with:

Multi-word string match: Autocomplete now supports matching across word boundaries, inclusive of mid-string matches
Quick completion with right arrow and tab: Both the right arrow and tab keys select the matched search term.
Up arrow and down arrow cycles between search terms: The Search Box is populated immediately with the search term selected via up/down arrow navigation so that the ENTER key submits the search immediately after selection.
