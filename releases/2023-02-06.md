## Overview

Domain Endpoint callbacks include `ip_address` when known, Generic PACS integration supports multiple `timestamp` formats, Domain Alerts support custom message.

## Improvements

- The [Domain-level Callback Endpoints](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025233632-How-do-I-register-callback-endpoints-for-my-domain-#h_01F1G5Y8MNH3D1SY6XQ2EKQ31Q) now include `ip_address` when the event is related to a video stream with an assigned IP address. This currently applies to:

| Event Type | IP Address Location in Payload |
| -- | -- |
| `camera.created` | `camera.ip_address` |
| `camera.updated` | `camera.ip_address` |
| `camera.deleted` | `camera.ip_address` |
| `incident.created` | `camera_ip` |
| `zone.created` | `camera.ip_address` |
| `zone.updated` | `camera.ip_address` |
| `zone.deleted` | `camera.ip_address` |

For example, see the new `camera_ip` included in the `incident` below:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "object": {
            "incident": {
                "camera_name": "Front Entrance",
                "camera_ip": "192.168.1.234",
                "counter_events": {
                    "segmentation_process_restart_count": {
                        "counter": "segmentation_process_restart_count",
                        "description": "47 \\u003e 0 means the network connection to the video stream is unstable have restarted 47 times in 15 minutes.",
                        "value": 47
                    }
                },
                "date": "2021-04-30T19:13:42.317-0000",
                "type": "incident"
            },
            "user": {
                "email": "hq-cams@acme.com",
                "user_id": "56X126755830642533906524"
            }
        }
    },
    "id": "f58a5ef2-fbc7-407b-bdeb-536bfde767da",
    "type": "incident.created"
}
```

And `camera.ip_address` included in the `zone.created` below:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "zone": {
        "name": "Entrance Zone", 
        "polygons": [{}]
      }
  }, 
  "user": {
    "user_id": "56X126755830642533906524", 
    "email": "hq-cams@acme.com"
  }, 
  "camera": {
    "name": "Front Entrance", 
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.234"
  },
  "id": "fa39462a-1730-4b28-b68d-adb7eec778bb", 
  "type": "zone.created",
}
```

- The [Generic PACS Integration](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409631039892-How-do-I-create-a-Physical-Access-Control-System-integration-Developer-s-Guide-#h_01FKM3JFPB500CC8RM34HXYFG0) now also accepts for the `timestamp` field unix epoch timestamps with millisecond precision (not just ISO 8601 strings).

- Domain incident alerts may now be given an optional custom message to be included in the alert (e.g. "contact support@acme.com to resolve this error.") at https://camio.com/domains/?domain=YOURDOMAINHERE
