## Overview

`incident.created` for `upload_queue_length` is now created only when exceeding the value specified by your domain setting `Min Upload Queue Length for Incident`.

## Improvements

- **Min Upload Queue Length for Incident** is a new Domain setting that determines the threshold for triggering `incident.created` callbacks to notify you of upload queue backlogs.
- **Icons for autocomplete** now show whether an automcomplete match is a user account, camera, or zone.

## Bug Fixes

- **incident.created queue counters use underscore only** to fix compatibility problems with JSON field names.
