## Overview

This release includes the following updates:

## New Features

- Add camio.com/release-notes - Adds a redirect so any Camio user can go to camio.com/release-notes to see the latest release notes for each user facing product without having to remember the Github url.
- Add custom event handling to Panzoom Viewer - This update adds the ability to view custom events in the list of events in the bottom right of the Panzoom viewer. Users can now jump to a specific section of the video by clicking on the underlined timestamp. For example, if a custom event called `cleaning_start` exists, it will be displayed in the list of access control events along with the time at which it occurred.
