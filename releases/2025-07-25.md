## Overview

New **Camio Chips** convert query phrases into interactive UI elements for faster searches, **improved date/time parsing** better matches natural language to forensic search interpretations, and **Action trigger thresholds** reduce false alerts by requiring multiple matching assessments over time.

## New Features

- **Camio Chips** convert parsed query phrases into interactive UI elements that can be edited in-place or saved for quick reuse. For example, "material partially blocking exit air vents in Cleanroom B12 from 5pm July 25th to 8am July 28th" become three chips: camera "Cleanroom B12", date range "5pm July 25th to 8am July 28th" and search text "material partially blocking exit air vents". Saved chips populate the search box with one click, making query variations faster and easier.

- **Action Thresholds** in Visual Agents Advanced settings let Actions trigger only after a specified count of matching assessments (consecutive or non-consecutive) within a given time interval per camera.

## Improvements

- **Enhanced date/time parsing** propagates date and timezone references in both directions when specifying ranges. "3pm to 5pm ET" now equals "3pm ET to 5pm ET", and "2pm July 25th to 3pm" equals "2pm July 25th to 3pm July 25th". Relative ranges like "in the last 3 hours" are now interpreted as "3 hours ago to now".

- **Group Policy/Action Management** now allows multiple users with **MANAGER** role in a Google Workspace Group to update that Group's Policies and Actions.

## Bug Fixes

- **Mixed case camera names** in Camera Group query links now correctly retain required capitalization when clicking camera names in Event tiles.

- **Autocomplete clicks** now retain search box focus, preventing typed input from incorrectly remaining in the query after selecting a suggestion.
