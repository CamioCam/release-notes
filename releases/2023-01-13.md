## Overview

Uses Openpath timestamp of access granted (vs. request), bug fixes

## Improvements

- Unauthorized access detection now uses the `timestamp` of the `entry.unlocked` event instead of its `requestTimestamp` so that the visual analysis is more likely to begin at the time that a person is visible in the scene.

## Bug Fixes

- The Pan/Zoom Viewer's Label editor no longer triggers the `s` hotkey for screenshots when typing a label with the letter `s`.
- The legacy Event Viewer recovers from an async loading error to resume loading videos.
