## Overview

Clickable timestamps to advance video playback, camio.com/release-notes, and bug fixes.

## New Features

- Clickable timestamps to advance video playback - the Pan/Zoom Event Viewer now displays the timestamp of any Event label that includes a timestamp as a click target that advances video playback to that precise timestamp instead of waiting for video playback to reach that point in the Event. For example, the label `_pos_cleaning_start:2023-01-05T04:37:47.000-0800` will be shown as:

- https://camio.com/release-notes now redirects to these release notes.

## Bug Fixes

- Pan/Zoom Viewer toggle with 'm' key - Fixes a bug where the Pan/Zoom Viewer wasn't toggled by the "m" key if the user was awaiting retrieval of videos from Camio Box.
- Editing labels in the Event Viewer - Fixes a bug where clicking on the Labels button did not display the labels for editing.
