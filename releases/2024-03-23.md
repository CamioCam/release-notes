## Overview

Use the selected Events to query their cameras, detect unauthorized entries across multiple readers using a single camera, and query parsing improvements and bug fixes.

## Improvements

- **Search Selected Cameras** is a new menu option that appears after having selected one or more Events using the check box on the Events shown in search results. The command issues a new query using only the camera names associated with the Events selected. The timestamp of the earliest Event selected is also included so that your investigation starts at the time period you were viewing when issuing this [search refinement](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/203033929#h_01HSPK98MBE1WB08A1ZGXKQ32Q).
- **Multiple OnGuard readers per camera** enables, for example, many turnstile readers to be analyzed by a single camera to detect unauthoirized entries across all readers.
- **repeated query term matching** in camera > zone > label precedence. For example, if a camera name is "Lobby" and a zone name is "lobby", the query **people in lobby lobby** is interpreted as people in the lobby zone of the Lobby camera.

# Bug Fixes

- **quoted strings** in Search History queries now issue the correct query when clicked.
- **member name is now indexed** for Twin Oaks access control events.
