## Overview

Auto-complete for the camera names and zones of [Camera Groups](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038487551-How-can-I-share-a-group-of-cameras-).

## Improvements

- The Search Box's auto-complete now includes the camera names and zones of all the cameras assigned to a [Camera Group](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038487551-How-can-I-share-a-group-of-cameras-) to which the authenticated user belongs. Previously, users who were members only of a Camera Group could not see the names of cameras shared with them until they saw an Event in their search results from a camera assigned to that Camera Group. Now, Camio collects the Camera Group assignments across all host accounts so that Camera Group members can see all cameras shared with them even before executign a search.
