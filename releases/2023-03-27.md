## Overview

Hardware estimating tool, quote tool for varying stream resolutions, Google Workspace Directory forced sync, Kisi delete button, date range parsing bug fix, and stream state status bug fix

## New Features

- The new [Hardware Estimating Tool](https://camio.com/tools/estimates/hardware) calculates the resources needed to process video streams of varying resolutions and features.
- The [Partner Quote Tool](https://camio.com/tools/plans/config) now supports streams of varying resolutions in a single quote.

## Improvements

- The [Kisi Integration](https://camio.com/settings/integrations/kisi) page now includes a Delete button that frees the Kisi account to be claimed by another Camio account.
- The [Guests](https://camio.com/guests) page now includes a sync button for Google Workspace Directory to fetch a user's new Group memberships immediately rather than wait for the 20-minute Directory cache expiration.

## Bug Fixes

- Stream states (online vs. offline) now reflect the latest status code reported by the Camio Box gateway and display a warning message when two or more streams with different ids share the same name in the same account (which used to be a confusing source of conflicting state reports).
- Date range parsing was fixed for cases in which the "from" portion specifies a date and time, but the "to" portion specifies a time only and is in the future relative to the current time of the query (e.g. "yesterday 7am to 6pm" when queried at 4pm now correctly interprets as "yesterday 7am to yesterday 6pm")
