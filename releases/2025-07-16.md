## Overview

New Search Box settings enable Search Mode choice of **Vector** (or **Keyword**) with option to constrain results to **top Nth percentile**.

## New Features

- **Search Box settings** to switch between **Keyword** and **Vector** Search Mode. This choice is now stored in the browser's local storage.

- **Vector Search Match Percentile** (in the Search Panel) enables you to show only those [Vector Search](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/39322237767956-Using-Vector-Search) results having scores in the top Nth percentile of scores in the search results.

## Improvements

- **'All' and 'Top' moved to Search Box settings** to free up screen real estate for the Search Box, especially on smaller mobile phones.

- **<TIME_RANGE></TIME_RANGE> delimiter** in Visual Agents [Policy](https://ai.camio.com/policy/) now interprets the time range specified within thosee delimiters with more precision than the current state of LLMs. For example, a policy that only applies at night in the beautiful California summertime might be: `Nobody other than Security Guards are allowed <TIME_RANGE>04:00 UTC to 13:00 UTC</TIME_RANGE>`.

## Bug Fixes

- **Brute force index for Vector Search** now serves as a backup to the default Tree-AH indexes, so that Vector Search can resort to a slower 100% recall index whenever Tree-AH results are poor.
