## Overview

Instant-on WebRTC live streaming, one-click Camera Labels accessible from any camera name, option to notify Camio p0 support on > 404 stream errors.

## Improvements

- [General Settings](https://camio.com/settings/general) now includes an option to "Autostart" WebRTC live streaming on all streams that match the current search query. This option is available only for Camio Box Gateways with support for Simulcast and WebRTC.

- All camera names, whether displayed as buttons or hyperlinks, now include a dropdown selection of the [Camera Labels](https://blog.camio.com/the-video-search-engine-for-cameras-too-d8a7bc7ef3ec) associated with that particular camera so that it's fast to see related related cameras. 

- Camio SRE notification is now a new paid option to escalate unusual camera stream errors to Camio's Site Reliability Engineers. This feature is for [registered domains](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025233632-How-do-I-register-callback-endpoints-for-my-domain-) only that want external assistance from Camio in diagnosing camera problems.
